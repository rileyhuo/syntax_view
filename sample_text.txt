I[Maxine, feminine, first, singular, subject, experiencer] remember the rainy day that my mother[mother, feminine, third, singular, subject, agent] took me[Maxine, feminine, first, singular, direct object, theme] to school. My father[father, masculine, first, singular, subject, theme] was sick with the flu and [father, masculine, third, singular, subject, agent]stayed at home that whole week; otherwise he[father, masculine, third, singular, subject, agent] would’ve taken me[Maxine, feminine, first, singular, direct object, theme]. He[father, masculine, third, singular, subject, theme] was a quick person. He[father, masculine, third, singular, subject, agent] liked [father, masculine, third, singular, subject, agent]to swing my backpack on his left shoulder, [father, masculine, third, singular, subject, agent]unlock the front door in two quick twists with his right hand, and [father, masculine, third, singular, subject, agent]push open the door with his left elbow like a precise routine. That day he[father, masculine, third, singular, subject, agent] stayed in bed under two blankets instead. "[mother, feminine, second, singular, subject, experiencer]Don't forget [mother, feminine, second, singular, subject, agent]to go to Wang Tai Tai's for dried orange peels." I[Maxine, feminine, first, singular, subject, agent] caught him[father, masculine, third, singular, subject, agent] mumbling to my mother[mother, feminine, third, singular, object of preposition, goal] when I[Maxine, feminine, first, singular, subject, agent] peeped into his room and [Maxine, feminine, first, singular, subject, agent]loudly repeated it to her[mother, feminine, third, singular, object of preposition, goal]. "Orange peels, ginkgo fruit, just take Western medicine. I[mother, feminine, first, singular, subject, possessor] don't have time." She[mother, feminine, third, singular, subject, agent] mumbles back, [mother, feminine, third, singular, subject, experiencer]impatient. The rain was not stopping any time soon, definitely not during our fifteen minute walk to school. She[mother, feminine, third, singular, subject, agent] held our flimsy black umbrella in one hand, and my sweaty, slimy fingers in the other. She[mother, feminine, third, singular, subject, experiencer] seemed tired when I[Maxine, feminine, first, singular, subject, agent] looked up [Maxine, feminine, first, singular, subject, agent] to search for a reassuring smile. We[NA, feminine, first, plural, subject, agent] walked down the slope that I[Maxine, feminine, first, singular, subject, agent] used to go up and down everyday, on the wet pebbles that were just slippery enough to catch us[NA, feminine, first, plural, direct object, theme] off guard a few times. We[NA, feminine, first, plural, subject, agent] would grab each other’s hands tighter.
